Astronomy Fundamentals

The Solar System:
Our solar system consists of the Sun and eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune), along with dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and moons.

Planets are divided into:
- Terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars): rocky, dense, with solid surfaces
- Gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn): massive planets composed primarily of hydrogen and helium
- Ice giants (Uranus, Neptune): composed of water, methane, and ammonia ices

Stars:
Stars are massive balls of gas that produce light and heat through nuclear fusion. Our Sun is a main-sequence star. Stars have life cycles: they form, mature, and eventually die, becoming white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes depending on their mass.

Galaxies:
Galaxies are vast collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter held together by gravity. Our Milky Way galaxy contains billions of stars. There are spiral, elliptical, and irregular galaxies.

Black Holes:
Black holes are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. They form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle.

The Universe:
The universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old, according to the Big Bang theory. It is expanding, and most of its content is dark matter and dark energy, which we cannot directly observe.

Space Exploration:
Humans have explored space through telescopes, satellites, space probes, and manned missions. Notable missions include Apollo moon landings, Mars rovers, and the International Space Station.
