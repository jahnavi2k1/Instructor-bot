Physics Fundamentals

Newton's Laws of Motion:
1. First Law (Inertia): An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. F = ma
3. Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Energy:
Energy is the capacity to do work. There are various forms of energy including kinetic energy (energy of motion), potential energy (stored energy), thermal energy, electrical energy, and more.

The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

Electromagnetism:
Electricity and magnetism are two aspects of the same fundamental force - electromagnetism. Moving electric charges create magnetic fields, and changing magnetic fields induce electric currents.

Optics:
Light behaves both as a wave and as a particle (wave-particle duality). Reflection, refraction, and diffraction are key optical phenomena. The speed of light in vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second.

Quantum Mechanics:
Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. Key concepts include wave-particle duality, uncertainty principle, and quantum superposition.
