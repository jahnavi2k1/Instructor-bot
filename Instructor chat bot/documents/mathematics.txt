Mathematics Essentials

Algebra:
Algebra is the branch of mathematics dealing with symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols. Basic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and solving equations.

Quadratic Formula:
For an equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, the solutions are:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

Calculus:
Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change. It has two main branches:
- Differential calculus: studies rates of change and slopes of curves
- Integral calculus: studies accumulation of quantities and areas under curves

The derivative of a function f(x) is denoted as f'(x) or df/dx. The integral is denoted as ∫f(x)dx.

Geometry:
Geometry studies shapes, sizes, relative positions of figures, and properties of space. Key concepts include:
- Euclidean geometry: plane and solid geometry
- Trigonometry: relationships between angles and sides in triangles
- Coordinate geometry: geometric figures on coordinate planes

Pythagorean Theorem:
In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the other two sides: a² + b² = c²

Statistics:
Statistics is the study of collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. Key concepts include mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and probability distributions.
